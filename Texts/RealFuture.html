Regarding the future, the verse in Michah says, &ldquo;Like the days you went out of Egypt, I will show him wonders&rdquo; -- referring to the future redemption from exile. Based on this, we&rsquo;re going to understand a lot of cool concepts. To start off, let&rsquo;s make a list of a bunch of questions regarding this verse, which we&rsquo;ll eventually answer. First of all, why does the verse compare the wonders of the future redemption to the wonders of the Exodus from Egypt? The question becomes even stronger based on the fact that the future redemption will be a lot greater than the one from Egypt, since we&rsquo;ll barely even mention the Exodus from Egypt in the future, according to the Talmud. That&rsquo;s one question. Another: why exactly does the verse need to say &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight:700">I will show him</span><span>&nbsp;wonders&rdquo;? Why not just say something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make wonders&rdquo; or &ldquo;there will be wonders&rdquo;? What so special about the fact that Hashem will </span><span style="font-weight:700">show</span><span>&nbsp;the wonders? That&rsquo;s two questions. Next: if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention so far like me, you would have noticed that the verse starts out in the 2nd person when it says, &ldquo;like the days </span><span style="font-weight:700">you</span><span>&nbsp;when out of Egypt,&rdquo; and it ends off in the 3rd person when it says, &ldquo;I will show </span><span style="font-weight:700">him</span><span>&nbsp;wonders.&rdquo; Who is this &ldquo;him&rdquo;? It should have just said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show </span><span style="font-weight:700">you</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">&nbsp;wonders.&rdquo; According to the simple meaning of the verse, the word &ldquo;him&rdquo; refers to the Jews as one unit. But still, why exactly does it switch from &ldquo;you&rdquo; to &ldquo;him&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s the 3rd question. Another (similar) question: the Zohar, on a kabbalistic level, explains the word &ldquo;him&rdquo; of the verse as referring to Moshe (a.k.a., Moses), even though the simple meaning of the verse is referring to the Jewish people as a whole. What&rsquo;s the connection between these two explanations? That&rsquo;s the 4th question (for now). Basically, now we&rsquo;re going to work our way up to a 5th question, so on the quest for this question we&rsquo;re first going to talk about some interesting concepts. </span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span>To start off, let&rsquo;s talk about miracles. In general, there are two types of miracles: #1 are Miracles that are totally beyond than nature, like the 10 plagues in Egypt and the splitting of the sea, and #2 are miracles that are enclothed within nature. This latter type is itself broken up into two types. #1 are miracles which are enclothed in nature in a way that it&rsquo;s clear that nature is only a &ldquo;garment&rdquo; to the miracle, and the miracle is clearly recognizable, like the miracle of Chanukah, which is that a flask of oil lasted for 8 days when it was only supposed to last for 1. #2 are miracles which are enclothed in nature in such a way that the &ldquo;garments&rdquo; of nature cover up the miracle so much that even the person to whom the miracle is happening doesn&rsquo;t recognize it at first. The Talmud gave an example for this last type of miracle in the form of a story. The story goes that two people are traveling on the road for a business trip, and one of them steps on a thorn. The thorn injured his foot so much that he wasn&rsquo;t able to continue on the trip, and he had to go home and lost out on his business opportunity. This person then got really angry about his situation. Later on, he found out that the other person boarded a ship later in the journey, which sank. After hearing this news, the injured person became really happy. That&rsquo;s pretty harsh. Basically, that&rsquo;s an example of a miracle that even the person to whom the miracle happens doesn&rsquo;t realize it at first. Anyway, there&rsquo;s a known concept in Chassidus that the spiritual source of the miracles which are enclothed in nature is higher than the spiritual source of the miracles that are beyond nature. And the spiritual source of miracles which are enclothed in nature in a way that the nature &ldquo;covers up&rdquo; the miracles is even higher. A support for this is based on what is says in Psalms, &ldquo;[Give thanks] to the one who does great wonders Himself,&rdquo; and the Rabbis of the Talmud interpret this verse to refer to miracles that even the person to whom the miracle is happening doesn&rsquo;t recognize it, and Chassidus comes along and explains that this is because these hidden miracles are from a spiritual level known as &ldquo;Himself,&rdquo; meaning that only He knows that it&rsquo;s a miracle. The level of &ldquo;Himself&rdquo; is a higher level than the other two types of miracles. Based on this, we can start to understand what&rsquo;s so special about the fact that the verse says &ldquo;I will </span><span style="font-weight:700">show you</span><span>&nbsp;wonders&rdquo; (which is our second question). The novelty in this is that in the future redemption, the miracles will come from this high level of &ldquo;Himself&rdquo;. Before we explain the connection of how this answers the question, we&rsquo;ll first find support for this idea that the miracles in the future redemption will come from the level of &ldquo;Himself&rdquo;. The proof for this is what it says in the Midrash, &ldquo;In the past [in the Exodus from Egypt] I and my court [of angels] walked before you [in the pillar of fire which was at the splitting of the sea], but in the future, only I.&rdquo; This shows that in the future, the wonders will come from this level of &ldquo;Himself&rdquo;. Now, back to how this answers our question of why the verse says &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight:700">I will show</span><span>&nbsp;him&rdquo;. The answer is that although the hidden miracles which come from this high level of &ldquo;Himself&rdquo; are in a way that only He knows that these are actual miracles; nevertheless, in the future &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight:700">I will show</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">&nbsp;him wonders,&rdquo; which means that it will be clearly revealed that these are actually miracles. So that officially answers the 2nd question, and now, the moment you might have been waiting for, we are going to now ask the 5th question. </span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span>That question is based on the beginning of our verse, which is, &ldquo;like the </span><span style="font-weight:700">days</span><span>&nbsp;you went out of Egypt.&rdquo; Now, I thought that the Exodus from Egypt was only in one day, since it says, &ldquo;Remember </span><span style="font-weight:700">this day </span><span>which you went out of Egypt,&rdquo; and it also says, &ldquo;...in order that you remember </span><span style="font-weight:700">the day</span><span>&nbsp;of your going out of Egypt.&rdquo; So, basically, the 5th question is: why does our verse say, &ldquo;like the </span><span style="font-weight:700">days</span><span>&rdquo; in the plural? The answer is that, in fact, the Exodus from Egypt includes the splitting of the sea, which was 7 days after the Jews left the physical </span><span style="font-weight:700">place</span><span>&nbsp;of Egypt. The reason that the Jews were still considered to be &ldquo;in Egypt&rdquo; before the splitting of the sea is because they were still afraid of the Egyptians. We&rsquo;ll now find a couple of proofs for this that the splitting of the sea is included in the Exodus. First of all, the commandment of remembering the Exodus includes within it the splitting of the sea, like it says in a commentary on the Talmud known as Tosefos, which is brought in the code of Jewish law, which says, &ldquo;One needs to mention daily the Exodus from Egypt and the splitting of the sea,&rdquo; and a commentary on the commentary Tosefos, known as Chasdei David, says, &ldquo;because the completion of the redemption was at the splitting of the sea.&rdquo; Another proof is that the splitting of the sea is included in the official script which Jews say on the first night of Passover regarding the story of the Exodus, and in that script it also records an entire discussion about the different number of plagues which occurred in Egypt and at the splitting of the sea, so we see (pun intended) that the splitting of the sea is also included in the Exodus. Therefore, our verse uses the word, &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight:700">days,</span><span>&rdquo; in the plural, to also include the splitting of the sea which was a few days later. If so, then why does it say, &ldquo;Remember </span><span style="font-weight:700">the day</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">&nbsp;that you went out of Egypt&rdquo;? The reason is that the main part of the commandment is to recall leaving the actual place of Egypt, and omitting the splitting of the sea doesn&rsquo;t prevent the commandment from being performed, except that mentioning it counts as a separate fulfillment of the same commandment. So that was the 5th question, but now we&rsquo;re about to ask the 6th and final question. To get there, we&rsquo;ll first talk about an interesting observation. An explanation of &ldquo;Like the days you went out of Egypt I&rsquo;ll show you wonders,&rdquo; is that in the future redemption there will be miracles and wonders which were in the Exodus from the physical place of Egypt and from the fear of the Egyptians which was at the splitting of the sea. This can be seen from what is says in the book of Yeshaya (Isaiah), &ldquo;The Egyptian Sea will be dried up&hellip; and there will be a highway for His people&hellip; as the day they went up from the land of Egypt&hellip;&rdquo; So we see that the miracles in the future will be like they were in the Exodus from Egypt. This leads us to our final question, which is: What exactly is the connection between the fact that in the future we will be shown these hidden miracles which come from this high level of &ldquo;Himself,&rdquo; and that in the future there will also be this miracle of the splitting of the sea like it was in Egypt? Basically, how are these two things related? That concludes all of the questions. Now, let&rsquo;s get to the answers. </span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span>To start off with the answers, we&rsquo;re going to explain some things first. Let&rsquo;s start explaining. So basically, earlier we talked about the two different types of miracles, miracles that are beyond nature, and miracles that are enclothed in nature. In general, there are two advantages of the miracles that are enclothed in nature versus the miracles that are beyond nature. The first advantage is seen from the fact that in the miracles that are beyond nature, the revelation of the infinite energy that is beyond the world, and which these miracles come from, happens in a way that nature becomes nullified, and, at the end of the day, this energy doesn&rsquo;t actually become a part of the world. But regarding the miracles that are enclothed in nature, the infinite energy which is beyond the world becomes actually enclothed even in this limited world itself. That is the first advantage of natural versus supernatural miracles. The second advantage is seen from the fact that the purpose of miracles in general is to reveal that God dictates nature, which is seen more clearly from the miracles that are enclothed in nature. The reason for this is that the revelation of God&rsquo;s power through the miracles that are beyond nature shows us that He can simply disrupt the [seemingly preexisting] laws of nature, but the miracles that are enclothed in nature show that He dictates the nature </span><span style="font-weight:700">itself</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">, that really all along the laws of nature have been according to His Will. So basically, the natural miracles fulfill the purpose of miracles in general better than the supernatural ones. That concludes the second advantage of natural versus supernatural miracles. You might be wondering something at this point, I know I am. I&rsquo;m wondering what is the actual difference between the two advantages. The first advantage was that through the natural miracles the infinite energy which is beyond the world can be enclothed even in the limits of the world. And the second advantage, which was that the laws of nature of the world are dictated from an infinite power, is basically the same thing as saying that in the world can be enclothed the infinite energy which is beyond the world. They both appear to be arriving the same conclusion, except from different ways. </span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span>We&rsquo;re going to ultimately understand the actual difference by first explaining what it says in a commentary to the Torah titled &ldquo;Akeydas Yitzchak,&rdquo; (otherwise known as &ldquo;The Akeyda&rdquo;), written by someone named Rabbi Yitzchak ben Arama from around the 1400s, as explained in different places in Chassidus, including a book called Ohr haTorah on verse 2 in chapter 8 of Genesis and in the Book of Chassidic Discourses from the Jewish year 5654 page 131, and from the year 5666 page 156, and form the year 5678 page 225. It says there in section 38 that even in the workings of nature it&rsquo;s possible to know the greatness of the Creator. Besides for the fact that through thinking about all of the various complex workings of creation it becomes apparent that there has to </span><span style="font-weight:700">exist </span><span>a mind behind everything, it will also become apparent that the power that runs this world must be totally infinite, as can be seen from the </span><span style="font-weight:700">continuity </span><span>of nature, which is the idea that all of the forces of nature are the same as they&rsquo;ve always been, the force of gravity always works, oil always burns, etc.. This shows that the ways of the world are run by a totally infinite force, since every limited force eventually weakens. The fact that all of the forces of nature don&rsquo;t just wither away shows that this world is run from an infinite power source. And even though it&rsquo;s known in the above quoted places in Chassidus that each creation has a specific, Godly life force enclothed within it which directs its nature, and this life force is limited, since a limited body, by definition, cannot receive an unlimited life force, so how can we say that God&rsquo;s power in creation is completely unlimited, that&rsquo;s only relative to the actual creations of nature themselves, but the continuity of the forces of nature is from an Endless power, which is beyond this idea of &ldquo;enclothment&rdquo; in nature, except that in order to know the greatness of this infinite power which is in charge of the workings of nature, a person needs to think about it. But when we see a miracle, a change in the forces of nature, we see immediately (even without thinking about it) that the forces of nature come from an Infinite power, which isn&rsquo;t limited to the world. Another advantage of the realization of this infinite power that comes from miracles versus the realization that comes from contemplating the continuity of the forces of nature is that even after thinking about the forces of nature, a person only realizes that there exists an infinite power which controls the </span><span style="font-weight:700">forces of nature</span><span>&nbsp;(which is itself limited), whereas when one sees a miracle, there&rsquo;s a recognition of this actual infinite power itself, which is totally beyond the limits of world. So seemingly this is an advantage of miracles, since a realization of the infinite power itself, which is in a way that&rsquo;s not at all related to the limits of the world, is better than a realization of simply how this power related to the limits of this world. However, from this very reason, we can turn the tables and say that it&rsquo;s really an advantage for the forces of nature. The advantage is that when one realizes the infinite power which is totally beyond the world through miracles, one only recognizes that this power can </span><span style="font-weight:700">disrupt</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">&nbsp;the course of nature, whereas when one contemplates the continuity of the forces of nature, one comes to a recognition that this infinite power can even exist in this limited world, which is an advantage. This whole concept is from the book of the Akeyda, as it&rsquo;s explained in the various different places in Chassidus. </span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span>So basically, we&rsquo;re still on our way to getting to the difference between the two advantages that we gave earlier about the natural miracles. To get there, we&rsquo;ll now discover something. If you&rsquo;ve been paying attention this far, like me, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that something that we just said in the book of Akeyda contradicts the first advantage of natural miracles over supernatural ones which we gave earlier. The first advantage was that natural miracles show that the infinite power can even be enclothed in the limited nature of this world. But this fact that the advantage of natural miracles is that they show that the infinite power can be enclothed within nature is seemingly contradicted by what we said in the Akeyda that seeing miracles (including the natural ones) show the </span><span style="font-weight:700">actual </span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">infinite power which is totally beyond the limits of the world. In one place we said that natural miracles show that the infinite power can be in nature, whereas in another place we said that they show that the infinite power is totally removed from nature. How is this to be reconciled? The answer is that really, these two seemingly contradictory statements work together, and they show two different aspects of how miracles reveal the infinite power to the world. The fact that we said that natural miracles show that the infinite power can be enclothed even within nature is exactly that, and doesn&rsquo;t need any further explanation. But the other statement made in the Akeyda that all miracles (including the natural ones) reveal the infinite power that&rsquo;s beyond nature, which seemingly contradicts what we just said that those miracles show that the infinite power can be enclothed in nature, really means that through seeing a miracle, specifically a natural miracle, we realize that really all along the forces of nature have been according to the infinite power. So there&rsquo;s no contradiction, and it turns out that the advantage that the Akeyda gave for the forces of nature and the advantage it gave for miracles corresponds to the two advantages of natural miracles which we mentioned earlier. The fact that the Akeyda said that a realization that the infinite power is in the world is through contemplation of the forces of nature corresponds to the first explanation which we said about the natural miracles over the supernatural ones, which is that they show that the infinite power can even be enclothed in nature. And the fact that the Akeyda said that through seeing miracles we recognize the actual infinite power which is beyond the limits of this world parallels the second advantage which we gave regarding the natural miracles, which is that they reveal that really, all along the forces of nature have been according to His Will.</span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span>We&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about the advantages of natural miracles over supernatural ones in order to ultimately answer our questions from earlier. We noted that the two advantages of natural miracles parallel two advantages of other concepts found elsewhere, thus resolving an apparent contradiction, and now we&rsquo;re about to explain the difference between the 2 advantages of natural miracles so that we will ultimately answer our questions. In order to do so, we&rsquo;re going to talk about a couple other things now. Basically, just like we gave 2 advantages of natural miracles over supernatural ones, we can also gives 2 advantages of supernatural miracles over natural ones. One advantage of supernatural miracles is that they are a lot more clearly recognizable than natural ones. Another advantage is also that these miracles, in one sense, reveal more that the infinite power dominates nature than the natural ones do. The reason for this is that regarding the miracles which are in nature, which cause the nature to still remain in its existence, it&rsquo;s only revealed that the dominance of the infinite power over nature is that the </span><span style="font-weight:700">forces</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">&nbsp;of nature are according to His will, but in the miracles that are beyond nature, the nature of the world becomes nullified in its existence, so in this sense they show how the infinite power rules over nature more than natural ones. And, based on this benefit, there is to say that the difference between the two types of miracles in their spiritual sources is that miracles which are enclothed in nature reveal the infinite power in a way that allows for limitations to exist. And therefore, regarding this revelation, the limited nature remains in its existence, except that its existence is according to His Will. However, the miracles that are above nature reveal the actual infinite power like it is, beyond the idea of limits; and therefore, regarding this revelation, the nature of the world becomes nullified in its existence. However, even so, there&rsquo;s still an advantage of miracles that are enclothed in nature, because specifically these miracles reveal the dominance of the infinite power over the forces of nature themselves, like we said earlier. &nbsp;</span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">EXTRA:</span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span>This detail is based on various Kabbalistic concepts, which require a brief introduction. Before we get to that introduction, let&rsquo;s get real. You might be wondering at this point how we can prove all of these things which we&rsquo;ve been saying, and especially the kabbalistic things which we&rsquo;re about to say. The answer is that all of these concepts are part of Torah, which is literally the most obvious truth ever. First of all, it makes sense that there has to be an intelligent being beyond this world, because if not, then how did this whole world get here? If you suggest the Big Bang, then how did that first particle get there? If you say that maybe this Infinite being created it, then we can also say that this Being can create the world however he wants! Moreover, why would he create this whole world without telling us what to do? Why would someone who&rsquo;s infinitely intelligent just do something for no reason and create some jungle where only the strongest survive? That wouldn&rsquo;t seem very nice. It makes perfect sense that He would actually tell us what to do, how to live in a normal way, and that that instruction wouldn&rsquo;t be stay in this world forever. Now, the Torah is the longest lasting document with the most commentary ever written on it and is the only candidate for this role as His instruction. There&rsquo;re </span><span style="font-weight:700">millions</span><span>&nbsp;of pages of commentary written on it. If it was all just made up, then what is there to talk about? The reason why there&rsquo;s so much to say is because the Torah is </span><span style="font-weight:700">infinite</span><span>. When He gave us His instruction, He gave us Himself. So there you go, now we can get to the introduction of the Kabbalistic concepts. Basically, let&rsquo;s start with the beginning. Basically, someone known as Rabbi Yitzchak Luria (1534-1572), otherwise known as the AriZal explains (based on earlier works of the Zohar, for sources see </span><span style="font-style:italic">Mystical Concepts in Chassidus</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">) that in the beginning there was only Him and his infinite power (his elaboration of this was published in a book called Eitz Chaim). Basically, in order to create this limited world, He needed to totally remove this infinite power. By doing so, he created a limited void, in which he filtered in the infinite power to sustain it. An example of this is seen from the perspective of a teacher and student. The teacher is a huge genius, and he wants to give over his knowledge to his student. If he just starts saying a bunch of complicated concepts, then the student won&rsquo;t be able to understand anything. The first thing he needs to do is to totally &ldquo;forget&rdquo; about the end product which he&rsquo;s trying to teach, and then work his way up to it in stages, until eventually the student can reach the end product. The same can be seen from the beginnings of creation as explained by the AriZal. </span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">Things: </span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;text-align:left"><span>So, if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention so far like me, you&rsquo;d have noticed that the first advantage of natural miracles over supernatural ones, which is that they show that the infinite energy can even be enclothed in the world, is seemingly contradicted by this last thing we just said, which is that miracles only reveal the </span><span style="font-weight:700">simple</span><span>&nbsp;infinite energy </span><span style="font-weight:700">like it is</span><span>, unrelated to limits! So how can we say that these miracles show that the infinite energy in a way that it&rsquo;s enclothed in nature and at the same time say that they show the infinite energy in a way that it&rsquo;s </span><span style="font-weight:700">not</span><span>&nbsp;enclothed in nature? It&rsquo;s an open contradiction! The answer is that when we said that the first advantage of natural miracles is that they show that the infinite energy is </span><span style="font-weight:700">enclothed</span><span>&nbsp;in the world, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that these miracles show that the infinite energy </span><span style="font-weight:700">reduces</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span style="font-weight:700">accepts itself into</span><span>&nbsp;nature; rather, it means that they reveal the simply infinite energy in a way that shows that the infinite energy actually </span><span style="font-weight:700">forces </span><span>nature to change itself to be according to His Will. Since the energy is totally removed from this idea of being &ldquo;enclothed&rdquo; in nature, it has the power to actually change it. So from this, it comes out that when we say that natural miracles are &ldquo;miracles </span><span style="font-weight:700">enclothed</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal">&nbsp;in nature,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s just an expression which really means that the these miracles dominate over nature in a way that causes the nature to change itself to be according to His Will. </span></p><p style="padding:0;margin:0;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;line-height:1.15;orphans:2;widows:2;height:11pt;text-align:left"><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;font-style:normal"></span></p></body></html>
